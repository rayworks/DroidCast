# DroidCast

[中文文档](/README_CN.md) [![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/rayworks/droidcast)

An experimental demo for capturing and displaying screenshot of Android devices in the WebBrowser.
It's compatible with Android OS 4.0+ and could be used as a convenient tool for taking a batch of
screenshots by different image formats && dimensions, reporting bugs and reviewing app features.

⚠️ Some hidden methods have been called via reflection which may break as Android OS evolves.

## Dependencies

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   [ADB tool](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

## Quick start

*   Connect your device/emulator
*   Install the apk

Download and install the prebuilt apk from [here](./apk/DroidCast-debug-1.2.1.apk) or install it directly:

    ./gradlew clean installDebug

*   Run the script (using `automation3.py` for Python 3.6+)

<!---->

    python scripts/automation.py

After that, the default web browser will be opened. You should see the screenshot now.

*   (Optional) Specify the target connected device and set the port of ScreenShot service

<!---->

    python scripts/automation.py -p 12346 -s 'your-device-id'

For more info, `python scripts/automation.py -h`

## Use it wirelessly

*   Get your device IP address (in Settings - System - About phone - Status) e.g : `192.168.x.x`
*   Enable adb over TCP/IP on your device: `adb tcpip 5555`
*   Connect to your device: `adb connect 192.168.x.x:5555` (replace `192.168.x.x` with the actual IP address)
*   Unplug your device
*   Go through all the steps under [Common usage](#usage)

To switch back to USB mode: `adb usb`.

<h2 id="usage">Common usage:</h2>

### Note

Once apk file installed, you can use the [python scripts](/scripts/automation.py) to automate the following `adb` related operations.

*   Install the apk properly on the phone (Don't install it via `Run 'app'` from Android Studio).

<!---->

    ./gradlew clean installDebug

*   Push the apk to the `tmp` folder

<!---->

    adb push ${your-project-path}/DroidCast/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/DroidCast-debug-1.0.apk /data/local/tmp

*   Start our internal server process for image processing by `app_process`

<!---->

    $ adb shell
    D1C:/ $ export CLASSPATH=/data/local/tmp/DroidCast-debug-1.0.apk
    D1C:/ $ exec app_process /system/bin com.rayworks.droidcast.Main '$@'
    >>> DroidCast main entry

![](/process_main.png)

*   Please note: On some devices,
    if you got the error "appproc: ERROR: could not find class 'com.rayworks.droidcast.Main', please replace the
    above value of `CLASSPATH` with the result returned by `adb shell pm path com.rayworks.droidcast`.

![](/apk_src_path.png)

*   Use `adb` forward socket connection from your pc to the connected device

<!---->

    $ adb forward tcp:53516 tcp:53516

*   View the image via web browser
    http://localhost:53516/screenshot or with the specific dimension and image format,
    e.g. http://localhost:53516/screenshot?format=png\&width=1080\&height=1920

Currently `png`, `jpeg` and `webp`, these image types are supported.
